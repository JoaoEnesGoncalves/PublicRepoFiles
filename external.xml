			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hey maybe it's bizarre, but in multiple BI systems where you want to prevent redundant calculations ---<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway let's say I want to pull info/ MDX/ Mondrian query some existing Microsoft SSAS cubes and pull it into Pentaho PDI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhm .... how do I configure that connection? Is it even possible out-of-the-box without heavy customization?<br />
<br />
I have all the proper connection credentials/ know the connection string. Just not sure if it quite works in Pentaho PDI. SSIS of course has a method for it.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hi!<br />
<br />
I get a file every day to use in my PDI solution, however, it comes with a specific name &quot;CompanyName_LoadBI_YYYYmmDD.HHMM.zip&quot;.<br />
Because date and time are variables, I can not put a specific name in &quot;Wait for file&quot; -&gt; &quot;File name&quot;.<br />
Remembering that there are not multiple files, it will always be the same file once a day almost always at the same time, but with different date / time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried to do the following in the &quot;File name&quot; field:<br />
C:\Users\Company\upload\.*CompanyName_LoadBI.*\.zip$<br />
<br />
<br />
But to no avail.<br />
Can you help me?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hi everybody, <br />
I've searched through several posts but couldn't find a solution to this problem.<br />
<br />
I've got a Job (<b>Job1</b>) that reads from disk the name of all the XML files in a specific input folder.<br />
This file names are then passed to another Job (<b>Job2</b>) that:<br />
<ol class="decimal"><li style=""><b>Reads the file </b>(StAX)</li><li style=""><b>Saves the content to a database</b>, whether the content of the XML satisfies specific requirements</li><li style=""><b>Deletes the imported file </b>from disk</li></ol><br />
<br />
<b>Job2</b> <i>Executes for every input row</i>, so it runs for every input file.<br />
<br />
The problem is: after several processed files, I receive an out of memory error &quot;<b>GC overhead limit exceeded</b>&quot;.<br />
<br />
Gievn the fact that I would like to be able to process thousands of files, how could I set my jobs structure in order to avoid this Memory Error?<br />
I thought that the job option &quot;<i>Execute for every input row&quot; </i>releases the memory after every single processing run, but it seems it's not the case.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I can't post the Job and Transformation files for privacy matters.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Increasing the spoon memory limit is not a solution for me. :D<br />
<br />
Any idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I use &quot;Get File Names=&gt; Mail&quot; steps to send attachments from some directory. Between them I need step that will check the correct address for each attachment.<br />
<br />
For instance short_filename is 1098235.txt so I need to find line in some text file that contains '1098235 <a href="mailto:some@address.com">some@address.com</a>' (earlier I will cat '1098235' from short_filename field... using JavaScript) and use e-mail addres for Mail step.<br />
<br />
So the file that maps numbers with e-mail address could have content:<br />
<br />
company_number; email_address<br />
1098234; <a href="mailto:x@address.com">x@address.com</a><br />
1098235; <a href="mailto:some@address.com">some@address.com</a><br />
1098236; <a href="mailto:z@address.com">z@address.com</a><br />
..; ...<br />
<br />
Any advice?</div>
